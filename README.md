# My personal website

Sources for my personal site hosted at [xeome.dev](https://xeome.dev).

I don't care about the code quality of this project, it's just a simple static site. I'm a kernel engineer, not a web developer. (its just html and tailwindcss)

You can create a PR if you want to make something better but the site should look the same as it is now.
